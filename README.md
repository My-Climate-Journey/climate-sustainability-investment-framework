# Climate-Sustainability-Investment-Framework

This framework was created as a tool for those seeking to make emissions reductions and sustainability related investments with the goal of mitigating the impacts of climate change.

This framework is meant to guide investment decisions, and is intended to be used in conjunction with individuals own standards for variables not described in the framework (such as financial return requirements, diversification goals, investment stage preferences, etc.).
